## 2026-03-24 — Interactive Terminal Emulator

### Enhancement
A fully functional browser-based terminal emulator has been added as a new `section id="terminal"`, positioned before the Contact section:

- **Real command interpreter** — visitors can type `help`, `whoami`, `skills`, `ls`, `cat <file>`, `date`, `ping`, `uptime`, `history`, `echo`, `source`, `clear`, and `matrix`
- **Virtual filesystem** — 7 readable files: `manifesto.txt`, `about.txt`, `skills.json`, `principles.txt`, `readme.md`, `secrets.txt`, `coffee.txt`
- **Command history** — Up/Down arrow keys cycle through previous commands within the session
- **Tab completion** — typing a partial command and pressing Tab auto-completes it
- **ASCII art boot logo** — TARS banner renders on terminal load and after `clear`
- **Matrix easter egg** — `matrix` command fires 3 seconds of falling character rain with a purple tint
- **Typewriter animation** — output lines appear character-by-character for a retro feel
- **CRT scanline overlay** — subtle horizontal-line pseudo-element over the terminal window
- **Color-coded output** — green for success, red for errors, purple/cyan/blue for system messages
- **Ctrl+L** shortcut to clear
- Hero CTA updated from "See my work" → "Try the terminal"

### Tradeoffs & Decisions
- JetBrains Mono font added (loaded from Google Fonts) for authentic terminal feel
- Matrix easter egg caps at 3 seconds to prevent user confusion
- Terminal auto-focuses when scrolled into view; clicking anywhere in the terminal window also focuses input
- Mobile: terminal scrolls within the body if needed, font size reduced on ≤640px

## 2026-03-23 — Interactive Particle Constellation + Live Activity Ticker

### Enhancement
The background constellation canvas is now alive and responds to visitors:

- **Mouse reactivity**: Particles gently drift toward your cursor. Connection lines near the cursor glow brighter and thicken, creating a "gravity well" effect.
- **Click ripples**: Clicking anywhere on the canvas fires a radial ripple wave that disturbs nearby particles with a burst of energy.
- **Live activity ticker**: Below the hero tagline, a subtle purple text ticker cycles through realistic "what Tars is doing right now" messages every 3 seconds. Animates in/out smoothly so it never jarringly snaps.

### Tradeoffs & Decisions
- Kept particle count at 120 max to preserve performance on mobile.
- Ripple energy burst capped at 120px radius to avoid chaotic particle flight.
- Ticker cycles 13 distinct messages — enough variety without being canned/robotic.
- Ticker starts at a random message so repeat visitors don't see the same first message.
